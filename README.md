# This is a work in progress, check back for more details!

### What is this:

This is a daylight resin printer based off of the excellent design of the Cristelia 3d printer, a lot of the files have been reused without modification however some had to be modified to suit my needs. Such as making the lead screw the much easier to find 8mm, switching the corner supports to square tubing in order to save money. Using an off the shelf nema to lead screw adapter.
